\value{
An uncertainty data cube
}
\description{
Calculate the uncertainty cube based on the probabilities
produced by the classifier. Takes a probability cube as input.
The uncertainity measure is relevant in the context of active leaning,
and helps the increase the quantity and quality of training samples by
providing information about the confidence of the model.
The supported types of uncertainty are 'entropy', 'least', and 'margin'.
"entropy" is the difference between all predictions expressed as entropy,
"least" is the difference between 100% and most confident prediction, and
"margin" is the difference between the two most confident predictions.
